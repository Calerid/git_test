This is Michael Braley's first project on GitHub using Git CLI!

I am starting my journey into web development. I plan to learn the front end (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) (at least to start!). You can follow my progress here on GitHub. 

I am also looking to network! If you like what you see, have suggestions, or job leads just drop me a message!
